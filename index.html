                        Shivaji Maharaj (1630-1680) was the founder of the
                        Maratha Empire and a visionary leader who fought against
                        the Mughal Empire and other foreign powers to establish
                        Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule for Hindus). Known for his
                        military genius, especially in guerrilla warfare, he
                        built a powerful navy and captured key forts across
                        western India. His reign emphasized good governance,
                        religious tolerance, and efficient administration.
                        Shivajiâ€™s legacy as a hero and symbol of resistance
                        against foreign oppression continues to inspire
                        generations in India. He was crowned Chhatrapati in 1674
                        and remains a revered figure in Indian history.

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Shivaji Maharaj was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri,
                    located near Pune, Maharashtra. His father, Shahaji Bhonsle,
                    was a Maratha general who served the Bijapur Sultanate,
                    while his mother, Jijabai, deeply influenced his upbringing.
                    Shivaji was brought up with a strong sense of Hindu culture
                    and values, which later shaped his vision of establishing a
                    free and sovereign Maratha state.

                <h2>Vision and Values</h2>
                <p>
                    Shivaji Maharaj was known for his strong vision to establish
                    a Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule of Hindus), a kingdom free
                    from the oppression of foreign powers like the Mughals and
                    Bijapur Sultanate. He was deeply influenced by his mother
                    Jijabai and the teachings of saints such as Samarth Ramdas.
                    His values centered on protecting his people, promoting
                    justice, and ensuring freedom of religion.

                <h2>Administration and Governance</h2>
                <p>
                    Shivaji Maharaj established an efficient and well-structured
                    administration. He divided his kingdom into provinces, each
                    governed by trusted officials. His Ashtapradhan (Council of
                    Eight Ministers) helped him in governing various aspects of
                    the kingdom, such as military, finance, justice, and foreign
                    relations.
                </p>
                <h2>Some of his key administrative reforms:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Taxation System:</strong> He abolished
                        oppressive taxes like the jagirdari system and instead
                        collected taxes directly from the peasants. The main
                        taxes were Chauth (25% of the revenue) and Sardeshmukhi
                        (10% extra tax), ensuring a stable income for the
                        kingdom.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Navy:</strong> Shivaji built one of the first
                        naval forces in India to protect the coastline from
                        foreign invasions, particularly from the Portuguese and
                        the British.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Religious Tolerance:</strong> Though Shivaji was
                        a devout Hindu, he respected all religions and appointed
                        Muslims to important positions in his army and
                        administration. He ensured that his soldiers respected
                        women and places of worship during his military
                        campaigns.
